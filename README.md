# Portfolio Submission for CS300

## Project One: Analysis of Run-Time and Memory for Data Structures

### Problem Solved
The main problem addressed was developing a software solution for ABC University to help advisors access and manage course information efficiently.

### Approach to the Problem
I used pseudocode to outline the steps for loading course data into a vector, validating the data, and storing course information. Data structures are vital as they determine how data is efficiently stored and retrieved, impacting overall performance.

### Overcoming Roadblocks
One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring the data was correctly loaded and validated, especially when dealing with various course prerequisites. I tackled this by carefully designing the pseudocode to handle different scenarios, conducting extensive testing to catch and fix errors, and incorporating detailed validation checks to ensure data integrity.

### Expanded Approach to Designing Software
This project enhanced my understanding of selecting appropriate data structures based on requirements, highlighting the importance of efficiency and scalability in software design.

### Evolution of Program Writing Practices
Throughout this course, my approach to writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code evolved significantly with a specific focus on data structures and algorithms. I gained a deeper understanding of how different data structures, such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees, affect the performance and scalability of software applications.

I learned to:
- Implement various data structures and understand their strengths and weaknesses in terms of time complexity and memory usage.
- Optimize algorithms for searching, sorting, and managing data, which enhanced the efficiency of my programs.
- Apply algorithmic thinking to solve complex problems and choose the most appropriate data structure for a given task.
- Incorporate validation and error-checking mechanisms specific to data integrity, such as ensuring prerequisite courses exist in the dataset.

## Project Two: Working Code to Sort and Print Courses

### Problem Solved
The task was to implement the software design, reading course data, sorting it alphanumerically, and printing course information along with prerequisites.

### Approach to the Problem
I used C++ to write the code, implementing a vector data structure for efficient storage and retrieval. The solution involved reading from a file, sorting the data, and providing a user-friendly menu for interaction.

### Overcoming Roadblocks
A significant challenge was designing the system to handle various user inputs and ensuring the course data was accurately sorted and displayed. I overcame this by implementing robust error handling, testing the code extensively, and refining the user interface to enhance usability.

### Expanded Approach to Designing Software
This project reinforced the importance of efficient data manipulation and the benefits of a well-structured codebase, improving my software development approach.

### Evolution of Program Writing Practices
I focused on writing clean, maintainable code with proper documentation and error handling, ensuring the program is user-friendly and easy to maintain.
